/* 
 * The Diamong Problem
 *
 * Let 2 classes (B, C) that derive from the same class (A)
 * If we define a new class D that derives from both B, C.
 * D class will inherit A class 2 times
 *
 * A	 A
 * |	 |
 * B	 C
 * \	 /
 *	  D
 *
 * If we wanted to refer to a method of A (let f()) from an object 
 * of D (let obj), there is an ambiguity as to which of the two A we
 * refer to. ex: 
 * obj.f(); // causes compilation error
 * It can be solved either by directly specifying to which
 * class we refer. ex:
 * obj.A::f(); // or obj.B::f();
 *
 * This ambiguity can be avoided by declaring that B and C virtually inherit
 * class A. ( class B: public virtual A {} AND class C: public virtual C {}
 *
 *    A
 * /	 \
 * B	 C
 * \	 /
 *	  D
 *
 * now you can just call
 * obj.f();
 * and since D has only one instance of A everything works fine
 *
 * NOTE:: The call to the base class constructor now has to be performed
 * from the last class that inherits it, thus D. Otherwise the default
 * constructor of A will be called and any call to another constructor 
 * of A from B and C are ignored.
